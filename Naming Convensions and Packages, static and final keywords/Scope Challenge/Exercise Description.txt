Write a small program to read an integer from the keyboard
(using Scanner) and print out the times table for that number.
The table should from 1 to 12.

You are allowed to use one variable called scanner for your
Scanner interface. You can use as many other variables as you
need, but they must all be called x. That includes any
class instances and loop control variables that you may decide
to use.

If you use a class, the class can be called X (capital), but
any instance of it must be called x (lower case).

Any methods you create must be also called x.

Optional Extra:
Change your program so that ALL variables (including the scanner
instance) are called x.
